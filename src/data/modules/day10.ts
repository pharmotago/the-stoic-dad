🚩 **The Mid-Point Inspection**

You have completed 1/3 of the Stoic Dad journey. The first 10 days were designed for one purpose: to build the **Fortress of Self**. 🏰

Before we move into Phase 2—where we focus on leading your partner and children—you must ensure that your own logic centers are fortified. A man who cannot regulate his own nervous system has no business trying to guide the nervous system of a child.

In Phase 1, you mastered:
1.  **The Epictetus Protocol**: Knowing the difference between what enters your home and what enters your soul.
2.  **The Red Mist Override**: Seneca's tools for prediction errors and cortisol management.
3.  **The Phantasia Filter**: Stripping away the toxic labels that turn minor messes into major catastrophes.
4.  **The Citadel Depth**: Finding solitude in the center of the supermarket siege.

✨ **The fortress is not a place you sit in; it is a way you stand. 🛡️**

🧠 THE BIOLOGICAL OVERRIDE

🧬 **Integration and Reflex**

Neuroscience shows that it takes approximately 10-21 days for a new psychological "reflex" to take root in the Basal Ganglia. 🧠 You have been manually overriding the Amygdala for 10 days. You are likely feeling the "Decision Fatigue" that comes with high-fidelity self-control.

This Capstone is designed to move these skills from "Manual" to "Automatic." By reviewing the core scenarios of the last 10 days, you are strengthening the "White Matter" pathways between your Prefrontal Cortex and your Limbic System.

You are no longer "Trying" to be Stoic. You are *becoming* a man whose default setting is Composure. ✅

⚔️ THE FORTRESS CHECK

This is a mental operational test. Review these scenarios and choose the response that demonstrates a fortified Fortress of Self.`,
        scripts: `📜 THE PHASE 1 COMMANDMENTS

1.  **Accept the Input**: Reality is what it is.
2.  **Delay the Response**: Silence is the shield.
3.  **Strip the Adjective**: Facts over feelings.
4.  **Audit the Leak**: Every failure is fuel.`,
        audit: [
            "🏆 MASTERY CHECK: Can you identify the exact physical sensation in your body that precedes a 'Red Mist' moment? (Heat, pulse, jaw). 🌊",
            "🛡️ CITADEL CHECK: Where is your 'Mental Fortress' located? Do you have a specific anchor phrase or image you use to retreat? 🏰",
            "⚖️ DICHOTOMY CHECK: What is one 'External' you are still trying to control (e.g. child's volume, partner's mood)? Can you surrender it today? ⚓"
        ],
        challenge: `🏁 THE 24-HOUR SILENT WATCH

For the next 24 hours, perform the ultimate test of Phase 1:

1️⃣ **The Volume Cap:** Do not raise your voice above a conversational level for any reason. 🤫
2️⃣ **The Label Fast:** Do not use the words "Bad," "Unfair," "Disaster," or "Nightmare" to describe anything in your home. 🤐
3️⃣ **The 5-Minute Entry:** When you arrive home, spend 5 minutes in the car or hallway practicing the Inner Citadel before interacting with your family. 🧘‍♂️
4️⃣ **The Evening Audit:** Sit for 10 minutes tonight and write down the single biggest lesson you've learned about your own character since Day 1. 📖`,
