        full_lesson_content: "🏛️ PART 1: THE THEORY\n\n🤬 The Madness of Expectation\n\nSeneca, the great Roman Statesman, wrote the definitive guide on rage: 📜 De Ira (On Anger). He defined anger not as a natural release, but as \"temporary madness.\"\n\nSeneca argues that anger stems not from what happens to us, but from our expectations of what should happen. 📉 You get angry at the traffic because you expected the road to be clear. 🚗 You get angry at your daughter for spilling the milk because you expected a four-year-old to have the motor skills of a surgeon. 🥛\n\n🧠 Neuroscience: The Prediction Error\nYour brain is a prediction machine. It constantly simulates the next 60 seconds of reality. When reality violates that simulation, the brain registers a \"Prediction Error.\" ⚠️\n\nIf you are tired and stressed, your brain interprets this error as an attack. This triggers the Sympathetic Nervous System. Your pupils dilate, your digestion stops (which is why you feel sick), and you flood with norepinephrine. 🧪\n\nThe \"Stoic Dad\" approach to anger is 👁️ Premeditatio Malorum (Premeditation of Evils). It is the practice of visualizing the worst-case scenario before it happens. If you wake up and tell yourself, \"Today, my children will be messy, loud, and ungrateful,\" then when they spill the milk, you are not surprised. You are prepared. ✅\n\nAnger is weakness. It is the admission that you did not anticipate reality. You were caught off guard. A leader is never caught off guard. 🛡️\n\n⚔️ PART 2: THE WAR STORY\n\n🏺 The Broken Heirloom\n\n🎬 The Scene: It is Sunday afternoon. You finally have an hour of quiet. You are working on a laptop 💻, or perhaps fixing something in the garage. Nearby, your six-year-old is playing with a ball inside the house—something you have expressly forbidden three times. ⚽\n\n💥 CRASH.\n\nThe ball hits your coffee mug. The mug tips. Hot coffee floods your laptop keyboard and shatters a framed photo of your grandfather on the desk. 🖼️\n\n😡 The Red Mist: The damage is double: financial (the laptop) and sentimental (the photo). The violation is clear: disobedience. The rage is instant. 🔥 You stand up, your chair scraping violently against the floor. You loom over the child. The child creates a fear response—shrinking back. You are about to unleash a verbal assault that they will remember for 20 years. 🗣️\n\n🛡️ The Stoic Pivot: The Stoic Dad freezes. ❄️ He looks at the shattered glass. He realizes: The glass is already broken. Screaming will not reassemble the molecules. He looks at the child. He sees the fear. He realizes: I am the monster in this room. 👹 He forces his hands into his pockets to prevent aggressive gesturing.\n\nHe whispers.",
        scripts: "📜 PART 3: THE TACTICAL SCRIPT\n\n🧘 1. To Yourself (Internal Monologue)\n🗣️ \"The object is broken. Do not break the relationship. Anger is a choice I am refusing to make. Delay the punishment until the emotion is gone.\"\n\n🛑 2. To The Child (Firm Boundary)\n🗣️ \"I am very angry right now. I cannot speak to you calmly. Go to your room and close the door. We will discuss the consequences in one hour.\"\n\n🤝 3. To The Partner (Tagging Out)\n🗣️ \"Code Red in the office. I’m going for a walk to burn this off. Don't let me talk to him until I’m back.\"",
        challenge: "⚡ PART 4: THE PROTOCOL\n\n🔌 The Circuit Breaker\n\n1️⃣ Step 1: Physical Separation.\nCreate distance immediately. Leave the room. 🚪\n\n2️⃣ Step 2: Cold Exposure.\nSplash cold water on your face. 🚿 This triggers the \"Mammalian Dive Reflex,\" which physically lowers heart rate and calms the nervous system.\n\n3️⃣ Step 3: The View from Above.\nVisualize the house from space. 🌍 Will this broken object matter in 5 years? In 5 months?\n\n4️⃣ Step 4: Re-engage Logic.\nOnce the pulse drops, determine the lesson. The lesson is about responsibility, not fear. 🧠",
