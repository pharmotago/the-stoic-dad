        full_lesson_content: "⚖️ PART 1: THE THEORY\n\n🌍 The Concentric Circles\n\nStoic Justice (Dikaiosyne) is not just about following the law. It is about your relationship with the tribe. The Stoic Hierocles described our duties as concentric circles: The Self 🧍, The Family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, The Community 🏘️, and The World 🌎.\n\nAs a father, you stand in the center. If you are unjust to your family, you rot the core. Justice involves two things: **Fairness** and **Service**.\n\n**Fairness:** You are the judge, jury, and executioner of the household. If you are capricious—punishing one child for what you let the other get away with—you breed resentment. Resentment is the cancer of family loyalty.\n\n**Service:** A Patriarch does not rule; he serves. 👑 He is the first to wake up and the last to go to sleep. He eats last. He checks the locks. He carries the heaviest load. This is not martyrdom; it is leadership.\n\n⚔️ PART 2: THE WAR STORY\n\n🥊 The Sibling Civil War\n\n🎬 The Scene: It is Sunday afternoon. You hear the crash. Then the screaming. You run into the playroom. The 7-year-old is holding a broken toy; the 4-year-old is crying on the floor. Both are pointing fingers. \"He hit me!\" \"She broke it!\"\n\n🤡 The Tyrant Dad: You are tired. You just want peace. You yell, \"I DON'T CARE! GO TO YOUR ROOMS! BOTH OF YOU!\" You punish the innocent with the guilty because you are too lazy to investigate. You have just taught them that truth doesn't matter, only power matters.\n\n⚖️ The Just Patriarch: The Stoic Dad enters the room efficiently. He separates the combatants. \"Corners. Now.\" He lowers his voice to a whisper (forcing them to be quiet to hear him).\n\nHe conducts the investigation. He listens to the Plaintiff. He listens to the Defendant. He checks the evidence (the toy). He renders a verdict based on cause and effect, not on who is crying louder.\n\n\"The toy was broken by accident, but you hit your sister in anger. Accidents are forgiven; violence is corrected. You will apologize to her, and you will help me fix the toy.\"\n\nJustice is served. The order is restored.",
        scripts: "📜 PART 3: THE TACTICAL SCRIPTS\n\n🤝 1. The \"Fairness Doctrine\" Script\nUse this when mediating a conflict.\n🗣️ \"I am not here to take sides. I am here to find the truth. Tell me what happened, fact by fact. No feelings, just data.\"\n\n🎒 2. The \"Servant Leader\" Script\nUse this when your partner is overwhelmed.\n🗣️ \"I see you are carrying a heavy load right now. Give me the backpack. Give me the baby. I have the watch. Go rest.\"\n\n🛡️ 3. The \"Apology\" Script\nUse this when YOU have been unjust (yes, Dads mess up too).\n🗣️ \"I was wrong earlier. I snapped at you without hearing your side. I was tired, but that is no excuse. I apologize. How can I make it right?\"",
        challenge: "🕵️‍♂️ The Anonymous Service\n\nTrue Justice seeks no reward.\n\n1️⃣ The Mission:\nFind one chore or problem in the house that no one wants to do. (The overflowing trash, the dishes in the sink, the car that needs gas).\n\n2️⃣ The Execution:\nDo it perfectly. Do it silently.\n\n3️⃣ The Silence:\nDo not tell anyone you did it. Do not fish for a \"Thank you.\" If they notice, just nod. If they don't, know that you upheld the standard. 🤫",
